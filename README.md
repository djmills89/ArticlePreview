### What I learned

Sometimes global styles aren't the answer.  I kept running into the problem where my footer wasn't padded correctly when it diplays profile, but looked good when it displayed the share feature.  I learned about creating popups, though I'll need more practice to do it mostly from memory.  And that sometimes simple seeming solutions aren't as simple as they first appear.

### AI Collaboration

Describe how you used AI tools (if any) during this project. This helps demonstrate your ability to work effectively with AI assistants.

- Used ChatGPT for general advice and code review.
- Only as good as the feedback you give.  I was struggling with my hidden class because I had given it an assumption that was no longer true.
